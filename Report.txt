Key Points at the time of Synopsis Submission
Suitable title selection for bca project
Make all necessary details about bca project which you want to developed.
Actually Synopsis is also known as project proposal, by the help of this you get permission from the university to developed proposed project.
Insert necessary diagram, platform, limitation, scope, bibliography in the synopsis.
It should be 15 to 20 pages approximately


 Approval of Synopsis
After submission of synopsis, it is evaluated by university
After evaluation and getting synopsis approval you can prepare project report


Project Report 
After approval you can start project report preparation
for BCA MCA B.Tech Program it should be 90 to 150 pages and you have to develop any software/ website or any application. In project report source code must be inserted. After submission of project you called for viva. At the viva time must keep project report + CD (Source Code)
